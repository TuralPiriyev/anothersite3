# Team Collaboration System - Fixes and Improvements

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Invalid Code Error
**Problem**: Users were getting "invalid code" errors when trying to accept invitations.

**Root Cause**: 
- Server-side validation was using case-sensitive matching
- Invitation data structure wasn't properly formatted
- Missing proper error handling

**Fixes Applied**:
- Updated invitation validation to use case-insensitive regex matching
- Enhanced error messages with specific details
- Improved data structure validation
- Added proper logging for debugging

```javascript
// Before
const invitation = await Invitation.findOne({ 
  joinCode: joinCode.toUpperCase(),
  status: 'pending'
});

// After
const invitation = await Invitation.findOne({ 
  joinCode: { $regex: new RegExp(`^${joinCode.toUpperCase()}$`, 'i') },
  status: 'pending'
});
```

### 2. Token/Code Error
**Problem**: Authentication and invitation flow had issues causing token/code errors.

**Root Cause**:
- Missing proper validation in invitation creation
- Inconsistent data handling between client and server
- Poor error handling in API endpoints

**Fixes Applied**:
- Added comprehensive validation for all required fields
- Enhanced error handling with specific error messages
- Improved data consistency between client and server
- Added proper logging for debugging

```javascript
// Enhanced invitation creation with validation
const { workspaceId, inviterUsername, inviteeUsername, role, joinCode } = req.body;

if (!workspaceId || !inviterUsername || !inviteeUsername || !role || !joinCode) {
  return res.status(400).json({ 
    error: 'Missing required fields: workspaceId, inviterUsername, inviteeUsername, role, joinCode' 
  });
}
```

### 3. WebSocket Connection Issues
**Problem**: Real-time collaboration wasn't working properly.

**Root Cause**:
- Missing proper connection handling
- Incomplete user management
- Poor error handling in WebSocket messages

**Fixes Applied**:
- Enhanced WebSocket connection with better user management
- Added proper connection state tracking
- Improved message validation and error handling
- Added comprehensive logging for debugging

```javascript
// Enhanced WebSocket connection
ws.send(JSON.stringify({
  type: 'connection_established',
  clientId: `client_${Date.now()}`,
  schemaId: schemaId,
  timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
}));
```

### 4. Database Integration Problems
**Problem**: MongoDB integration for invitations and members wasn't working correctly.

**Root Cause**:
- Missing proper data validation
- Inconsistent data structures
- Poor error handling

**Fixes Applied**:
- Added comprehensive validation for all database operations
- Enhanced data structures with proper typing
- Improved error handling with specific messages
- Added proper logging for debugging
