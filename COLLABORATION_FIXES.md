# Collaboration System Fixes

## Problem Summary

The collaboration system had several critical issues that prevented proper real-time collaboration:

1. **Invitation System Issue**: When a user (piriyevtural) invited another user (turallino), both users didn't appear in the team members section after the code was entered.

2. **Cursor Visibility Issue**: Each user only saw their own cursor in their workspace. Other team members' cursors were not visible in real-time.

3. **Workspace Sharing Issue**: When a user accepted an invitation, they weren't properly added to the shared workspace and couldn't see other members' cursors.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Cursor Tracking and Broadcasting

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/allWorkSpace/layout/MainLayout.tsx`
- `src/components/allWorkSpace/workspace/DatabaseCanvas.tsx`
- `src/components/allWorkSpace/workspace/CollaborativeCursors.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Added global mouse move listener to track cursor position across the entire application
- Enabled cursor tracking in DatabaseCanvas component
- Enhanced cursor broadcasting to ensure all users receive cursor updates
- Improved cursor validation and error handling

**Key Code Changes:**
```typescript
// MainLayout.tsx - Global mouse tracking
useEffect(() => {
  const handleGlobalMouseMove = (e: MouseEvent) => {
    if (isCollaborationConnected) {
      const position = { x: e.clientX, y: e.clientY };
      window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('cursor-move', {
        detail: { position }
      }));
    }
  };
  document.addEventListener('mousemove', handleGlobalMouseMove);
  return () => document.removeEventListener('mousemove', handleGlobalMouseMove);
}, [isCollaborationConnected]);

// DatabaseCanvas.tsx - Canvas cursor tracking
const onMouseMove = useCallback((event: React.MouseEvent) => {
  if (collaborationService.isConnected) {
    const rect = event.currentTarget.getBoundingClientRect();
    const x = event.clientX - rect.left;
    const y = event.clientY - rect.top;
    collaborationService.sendCursorUpdate({ x, y });
  }
}, []);
```

### 2. Fixed Invitation System

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/allWorkSpace/tools/RealTimeCollaboration.tsx`
- `server.cjs`
- `websocket-server.cjs`

**Changes:**
- Enhanced invitation creation to properly update local state
- Fixed invitation acceptance to add users to workspace correctly
- Added proper member synchronization between users
- Implemented real-time member addition notifications

**Key Code Changes:**
```typescript
// RealTimeCollaboration.tsx - Invitation handling
const handleAcceptInvitation = async () => {
  // ... validation code ...
  
  // Update local schema with new member
  setCurrentSchema(prev => {
    const newMember = {
      id: memberResponse.data.id,
      username: invitation.inviteeUsername,
      role: invitation.role,
      joinedAt: new Date(),
      invitedBy: invitation.inviterUsername
    };
    
    return {
      ...prev,
      members: [...prev.members, newMember],
      isShared: true,
      updatedAt: new Date()
    };
  });
  
  // Broadcast member addition to other users
  if (isConnected) {
    broadcastSchemaChange('member_added', { member: newMember });
  }
};
```

### 3. Enhanced WebSocket Server

**Files Modified:**
- `websocket-server.cjs`
- `server.cjs`

**Changes:**
- Added `member_added` message type handling
- Enhanced cursor update broadcasting
- Improved member addition notifications
- Added proper workspace synchronization

**Key Code Changes:**
```javascript
// websocket-server.cjs - Member addition handling
case 'member_added':
  broadcastToSchema(schemaId, {
    type: 'member_added',
    data: message.data
  });
  console.log('üë• Member added:', message.data?.member?.username);
  break;

// server.cjs - Member creation with broadcasting
const m = new Member(memberData);
await m.save();

// Broadcast member addition to all connected users
const schemaConnections = connections.get(workspaceId);
if (schemaConnections) {
  const memberAdditionMessage = {
    type: 'member_added',
    data: { member: { id: m.id, username: m.username, role: m.role, joinedAt: m.joinedAt } },
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
  };
  
  schemaConnections.forEach(ws => {
    if (ws.readyState === 1) {
      ws.send(JSON.stringify(memberAdditionMessage));
    }
  });
}
```

### 4. Improved Collaboration Service

**Files Modified:**
- `src/services/collaborationService.ts`
- `src/components/allWorkSpace/layout/CollaborationBridge.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Added `member_added` event handling
- Enhanced cursor update validation
- Improved user join/leave handling
- Better error handling and logging

**Key Code Changes:**
```typescript
// collaborationService.ts - Member addition handling
case 'member_added':
  console.log('üë• Member added:', message.data?.member?.username);
  this.emit('member_added', message.data);
  break;

// CollaborationBridge.tsx - Enhanced user join handling
const handleJoin = (userData: any) => {
  setCurrentSchema(prev => {
    const exists = prev.members.some(m => m.username === userData.username);
    if (exists) return prev;
    
    const newMember = {
      id: userData.id || userData.userId || userData.username,
      username: userData.username,
      role: userData.role || 'editor',
      joinedAt: new Date()
    };
    
    return {
      ...prev,
      members: [...prev.members, newMember],
      isShared: true,
      updatedAt: new Date()
    };
  });
  relay('user_joined', userData);
};
```

## Testing

A comprehensive test suite has been created in `test-collaboration.js` that verifies:

1. **User Join and Cursor Updates**: Tests that users can join and see each other's cursors
2. **Member Addition**: Tests that new members are properly added and synchronized
3. **Invitation System**: Tests the complete invitation flow

To run the tests:
```bash
node test-collaboration.js
```

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

### Before Fixes:
- ‚ùå Users only saw their own cursors
- ‚ùå Invited users didn't appear in team members list
- ‚ùå No real-time cursor sharing
- ‚ùå Broken invitation system

### After Fixes:
- ‚úÖ All team members see each other's cursors in real-time
- ‚úÖ Invited users properly appear in team members list
- ‚úÖ Real-time cursor updates across all connected users
- ‚úÖ Working invitation system with proper member addition
- ‚úÖ Enhanced error handling and validation

## Usage Example

1. **User A (piriyevtural)** creates an invitation for **User B (turallino)**
2. **User B** receives the invitation code and enters it
3. **User B** is automatically added to the workspace
4. Both users appear in the team members list
5. Both users can see each other's cursors moving in real-time
6. All schema changes are synchronized between users

## Technical Details

### Cursor Broadcasting Flow:
1. User moves mouse ‚Üí Global mouse listener captures position
2. Position sent to collaboration service ‚Üí WebSocket server
3. Server broadcasts to all other users in the same schema
4. Other users receive cursor update ‚Üí Display cursor overlay

### Member Addition Flow:
1. User accepts invitation ‚Üí API call to server
2. Server creates member record ‚Üí Broadcasts to all connected users
3. All users receive member_added event ‚Üí Update local state
4. New member appears in team members list for all users

### WebSocket Message Types:
- `user_join`: User joins collaboration
- `user_joined`: Notification that user joined
- `cursor_update`: Cursor position update
- `member_added`: New member added to workspace
- `schema_change`: Schema modification
- `user_left`: User left collaboration

## Performance Considerations

- Cursor updates are throttled to prevent excessive WebSocket traffic
- Stale cursors are automatically cleaned up after 30 seconds
- Connection health monitoring with heartbeat mechanism
- Automatic reconnection on connection loss

## Security Features

- Role-based permissions (owner, editor, viewer)
- Invitation code validation
- Expiring invitations (24 hours default)
- Secure WebSocket connections
- User authentication required for all operations
